# Delaunay-Terrain-Test
A small demo for constructing a terrain TIN model using the idea of dimensionality reduction Delauany triangulation
Simple terrain display using OpenGL+GLFW+glad, no textures or light maps etc,only the mesh is displayed.
In addition, there is a class for KDTree sorting of the input point set, which is used to test the effect of input order on the performance of the structured mesh
